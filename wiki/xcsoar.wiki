I asked Flymaster about the NMEA documentation. Here is the answer:

"Hi Bjørn,

The only NMEA sentence output during navigation that is specific sent to F1 is the vario
and barometric altitude:

$VARIO,fPressure,fVario,Bat1Volts,Bat2Volts,BatBank,TempSensor1,TempSensor2*CS

Where:
fPressure = the absolute atmospheric pressure, converting to altitude use the following:
     fBarAltitude = (1 - pow(fabs(fPressure / fQNH),  0.190284)) * 44307,69;

fVario = the variometer in m/s
Bat1Volts = the voltage of the battery in bank 1
Bat2Volts = the voltage of the battery in bank 2
BatBank = the battery bank in use.
TempSensor1 = temperature in ºC of external wireless sensor 1
TempSensor2 = temperature in ºC of external wireless sensor 2
CS = the standard NMEA checksum.

This sentence is sent at 2hz (i.e. 2 times a second).

The rest of the sentences are all standard NMEA GPS stuff ($GPRMC, $GPGGA, etc...)


Best regards,
Cristiano"
